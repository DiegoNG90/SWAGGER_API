# API with Swagger and Typescript

## New tools/packages

- Swagger for api documentation purpose
- lowdb module for creating a tiny json db.
- nanoid (similar to short-id, for creating tiny id's on the spot)
- request folder (creating http requests as .http files with the 'REST Client' VSCode extension). Very useful instead of using Postman or Insomnia -as usual :P-.
